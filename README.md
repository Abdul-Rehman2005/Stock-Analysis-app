Streamlit-Stock-Analyzer
I developed an interactive Stock Analysis Dashboard that allows users to search and analyze any stock over the past 5 years using real-time data from Yahoo Finance. The dashboard includes comprehensive visualizations such as candlestick charts and volume plots, as well as popular technical indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD, all powered by the ta library. It also provides a detailed data summary including key metrics such as current price, daily percentage and dollar change, highest and lowest prices and volumes, and their averages. Built using Streamlit, the app delivers a responsive and user-friendly interface for financial analysis and trading insights.

Libraries used: streamlit, yfinance, plotly, ta, datetime
